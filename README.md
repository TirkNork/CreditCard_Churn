# Credit Card Churn Prediction with Machine Learning 


The purpose of this project is to analyze a dataset to understand why customers canceled their credit cards and predict future cancellations.
Python is utilized for visualization, feature engineering, preprocessing, and applying predictive models such as Decision Trees, Random Forests,
K-Nearest Neighbors, and Neural Networks. Additionally, unsupervised learning techniques, including the K-means clustering model, are applied to
cluster data, allowing for customer segmentation and analysis of insights within each group.
